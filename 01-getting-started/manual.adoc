This document provides a quick demonstration of how to try Kumori PaaS platform
and deploy your first *Hello-World* application in less than 5 minutes.

Kumori PaaS lets you create and deploy scalable services, managing the
complexity of their life cycle, letting you focus on their functionality.

Building complex services is simple when following our service model. Our tools
let you get started quickly.


== A simple example

Before working with Kumori PaaS you need to https://discover.kumori.cloud[sign up]
(if you have not done so already).

After signing up you will be able to interact with the platform and manage your
services through its https://dashboard.baco.kumori.cloud[Dashboard].

We also offer a command-line interface tool, that you will be using in what
follows.


=== Prerequisites

You will need https://www.docker.com/community-edition[docker] installed in
your machine.

WARNING: As stated in the Docker installation guide, to use Docker as a
non-root user, you should add your user to the "docker" group with: +
`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

You also need http://nodejs.org[nodejs] 8.9 or later (with npm) to install and
run the tools.

Then you can install Kumori CLI as follows:

[source,shell]
----
sudo npm install -g @kumori/cli
----

=== Simple express server

Create a directory for your project, and go into it:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir simpleweb
cd simpleweb
----

Initialize the project workspace:

[source,shell]
----
kumori init
----

Kumori's naming scheme for services and components uses a domain name belonging
to the user to avoid name collisions. You should now configure that domain name
with the CLI for your project:

[source,shell]
----
kumori set domain <your_domain>
----

Now we are ready to start building our service. Our simple service will have
just one component (the web server). We offer a set of templates which you can
use to quickly implement simple service patterns. We make use of one of them:

[source,shell]
----
kumori project add -t @kumori/workspace:project-hello-world <name>
----

This populates your workspace with the Hello World example elements including:

* A component skeleton within the `components/<your_domain>/<name>`
  directory. Note that the internal name this component will receive is
  `eslap://<your_domain>/component/<name>/0_0_1` (further details can be found
  in the
  https://github.com/kumori-systems/documentation[Building Services for the Kumori PaaS]
  guide).

* A service in `services/<your_domain>/<name>` folder. Also note that the
  internal name of the created service app is
  `eslap://<your_domain>/service/<name>/0_0_1`.

For this example, we can leave the component and service as they are.

Before we can actually deploy, we need to configure our workspace with a valid API access token.
This token can be obtained from https://dashboard.baco.kumori.cloud[Kumori Dashboard] - Settings page (three-dot menu at the top right).

With the token in our hands we use:

[source,shell]
----
kumori stamp update -t <token> baco
----

NOTE: `baco` is the current production version of Kumori PaaS.

And now we can deploy like so:

[source,shell]
----
kumori deployment deploy <name> -b -i
----

Which will return us an URL to browse the service we just deployed. The `-b` flag tells the CLI to compile the component before deploying the service. The `-i` flag is used to generate automatically an HTTP inbound with a random domain and link it to our service.

NOTE: An HTTP inbound is a special service used to enable HTTP external access to other services. The inbounds must be paired to a domain which can be either generated automatically or manually set.
