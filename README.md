## Quickstart guide

This document describes the basic elements of Kumori PaaS, and guides the
developer through the implementation and deployment of two example Node.js
applications.

For sure, this is *not* a complete manual or a full reference guide of Kumori
PaaS. In fact, what we will show you here is only a small part of the full
potential of the platform.

The guide is available in the [02-quickstart-guide directory](02-quickstart-guide/README.adoc)
or can be downloaded as a [PDF file here](02-quickstart-guide/README.pdf).
